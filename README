NAME
    Math::EasyGSL - Perl bindings to GSL (GNU Scientific Library)

VERSION
    Version 0.001

SYNOPSIS
     # the main module Math::EasyGSL has just functions providing simple info
     use Math::EasyGSL ':all';
     print "Welcome to Math::EasyGSL based on GSL-v=", GSL_VERSION, "\n";
 
     # the real math related function are in accompanying modules
     use Math::EasyGSL::Statistics ':all';
     my @data = (11, 12, 13, 14, 15);
     print "Mean=", stats_mean(\@data), "\n";

    This module is not intended as a replacement for Math::GSL.

    Math::EasyGSL is not covering 100% of all GSL functions. It binds into
    perl just part of GSL library (I am adding more functions on "if-needed"
    basis - if you miss something let me know).

    On the other hand the interface of Math::EasyGSL is more perl-friendly
    than Math::GSL - it is not 1:1 translation of the original C functions.

EXPORT
    By default there are no functions exported. You can import into your
    program all available functions by calling:

     use Math::EasyGSL ':all';

    Or you can import just selected functions:

     use Math::EasyGSL::PDF qw(GSL_VERSION);

    There are no other import tags.
